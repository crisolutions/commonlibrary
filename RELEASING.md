# Releasing

* `dev` is only merged to `master` for a release.

* Make sure the [builds are passing](https://travis-ci.org/crisolutions/commonlibrary) before merging in.

* After the merge, create a new release from GitHub with the appropriate incremented versions. [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#crisolutions/commonlibrary) will take care
 of creating a new artifact.
